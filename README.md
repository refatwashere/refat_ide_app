# refat_ide_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Here's a structured approach for building a VS Code-like mobile IDE using Flutter, including terminal and extensions support:

```

### **Key Features Implementation**

1. **VS Code-like Layout**
   - Use `SplitView` widget for resizable panels
   - Custom `ActivityBar` for left-side navigation icons
   - `PersistentBottomSheet` for terminal panel
   - Implement tabbed interface with `TabBar` and `TabView`

2. **Terminal Integration**
   - **Backend**: Use `dart:io` or `flutter_process` package
   - **UI**: 
     ```dart
     TerminalView(
       controller: TerminalController(terminalService),
       style: TerminalStyle(
         fontSize: 12,
         fontFamily: 'Monospace',
       ),
     )
     ```
   - **Features**: Multiple sessions, basic commands support

3. **Extensions System**
   - **Extension Model**:
     ```dart
     class IDEExtension {
       final String id;
       final String name;
       final String version;
       bool enabled;
       // Manifest, activation logic, etc.
     }
     ```
   - **Extension Service**:
     - Load/unload extensions
     - Manage lifecycle
     - Sandboxed execution environment

4. **Code Editor**
   - Use `CodeMirror` (via `flutter_code_editor`) or `CodeField` from `highlight` package
   - Features:
     - Syntax highlighting
     - Basic code completion
     - File-based tab system
     - Line numbers/gutter

### **Dependencies (pubspec.yaml)**
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  # UI & Layout
  flutter_split_view: ^1.0.0
  provider: ^6.0.0 # State management

  # Editor
  flutter_code_editor: ^0.3.0
  highlight: ^0.7.0

  # Terminal
  xterm: ^3.0.0 # Terminal emulator
  flutter_process: ^1.0.0 # Process management

  # Extensions
  isolate: ^2.0.0 # For sandboxing
  dart_eval: ^0.5.0 # Optional for script execution

  # File Management
  file_picker: ^5.0.0
  path_provider: ^2.0.0
```

### **Critical Implementation Notes**

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use `ListView.builder` for file explorer
   - Implement editor disposal logic
   - Use isolates for heavy operations

2. **Terminal Security**:
   - Restrict dangerous commands (rm, format, etc.)
   - Implement permission system
   - Sandbox file system access

3. **Extensions Architecture**:
   ```dart
   // Extension activation
   void activateExtension(IDEExtension extension) {
     // Load JS/DSL scripts
     // Register commands with CommandPalette
     // Inject UI contributions
     // Initialize sandboxed environment
   }
   ```

4. **State Management**:
   - Use BLoC or Provider for complex states
   - Maintain:
     - Open files state
     - Terminal sessions
     - Extension registry
     - UI layout preferences

5. **Platform Considerations**:
   - **iOS**: Sandboxed file system limitations
   - **Android**: Request necessary permissions
   - Use platform channels for native operations

### **Sample Workflow**
1. User opens project folder
2. File explorer shows hierarchy
3. Clicking file opens editor tab
4. Terminal starts in project directory
5. Extensions add language support/tools

This structure provides scalability while maintaining VS Code-like UX patterns. Start with core editor + terminal functionality before implementing the extension system.
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

### **Development Tips**
- Use `flutter run` to test changes in real-time.
- Regularly commit changes to version control.
- Write unit tests for critical components.
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for code quality issues.
- Leverage Flutter DevTools for performance profiling and debugging.
- Keep dependencies updated to benefit from the latest features and fixes.
- Engage with the Flutter community for support and feedback.
- Document your code and architecture decisions for future reference.
- Consider using CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment.
- Explore Flutter packages for additional functionality, such as state management, networking, and UI components.
- Stay updated with Flutter's latest releases and best practices.
- **Enable error monitoring**: The app uses Firebase Crashlytics for real-time error reporting. Ensure Firebase is configured for your project and monitor the Crashlytics dashboard for issues.
- **Improve accessibility**: Key widgets, such as the code editor, are wrapped with `Semantics` for screen reader support. Review and expand accessibility coverage as needed.

### **Error Monitoring**
This project integrates [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics) for real-time error monitoring. All uncaught errors and Flutter errors are automatically reported. To enable:
1. Set up Firebase for your app (see the [Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)).
2. Ensure your `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) are included in the respective platform folders.
3. Monitor errors in the Firebase Crashlytics dashboard.

### **Accessibility**
Accessibility is a priority. The code editor and other interactive widgets use Flutter's `Semantics` widget to provide screen reader support. To further improve accessibility:
- Add meaningful labels to all interactive widgets.
- Test with screen readers on Android and iOS.
- Follow [Flutter accessibility best practices](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/accessibility).

### **Future Enhancements**
- Implement collaborative editing features.
- Add support for multiple programming languages.
- Integrate with cloud storage services for file management.
- Enhance the terminal with advanced features like SSH support.
- Create a marketplace for extensions with user ratings and reviews.
- Implement a plugin system for third-party developers to create extensions.
- Explore AI-assisted coding features for code suggestions and error detection.
- Add a debugging tool for running and testing code within the IDE.
- Implement a version control system integration (e.g., Git).
- Create a user-friendly onboarding experience for new users.
- Optimize the app for performance on low-end devices.

### **Testing**
- Write unit tests for critical components using the `flutter_test` package.
- Use integration tests to verify the overall functionality of the app.
- Test on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
- Use Flutter's hot reload feature to quickly iterate on UI changes.
- Regularly run `flutter analyze` to catch potential issues early.
